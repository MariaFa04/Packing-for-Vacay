          <blockquote>
            <li>
              Home to the University of Florida, Gainsville is definitely worth

            <li>
              The Everglades are like a shallow spoon, where the rim of the
              spoon represents a ridge of limestone. This is where the cities
              are built. As you go more south, the spoon becomes so depressed
              that land and water merge in a wilderness of salt marshes,
              mangrove swamps and lonely beaches.
